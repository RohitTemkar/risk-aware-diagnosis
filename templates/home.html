                <h1>Breast Cancer</h1>

                <p>Breast cancer is a malignant tumor that develops from the cells of the breast. It is the most common
                    cancer among women worldwide, affecting both developed and developing countries. While predominantly
                    occurring in women, men can also develop breast cancer, though it is rare.</p>

                <h2>Anatomy and Physiology of the Breast</h2>
                <p>The human breast consists of lobules (milk-producing glands), ducts (which transport milk to the
                    nipple), and stromal tissues, including fat and connective tissues. Lymphatic vessels in the breast
                    drain into lymph nodes, primarily located under the arm (axillary lymph nodes). Understanding this
                    anatomy is crucial, as breast cancer commonly originates in the ducts or lobules.</p>

                <h2>Types of Breast Cancer</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Non-invasive (in situ) cancers:</strong> These cancers remain confined to their origin
                        without invading surrounding tissues. Examples include Ductal Carcinoma In Situ (DCIS) and
                        Lobular Carcinoma In Situ (LCIS).</li>
                    <li><strong>Invasive (infiltrating) cancers:</strong> These cancers spread into surrounding breast
                        tissues. The most common types are Invasive Ductal Carcinoma (IDC) and Invasive Lobular
                        Carcinoma (ILC).</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Other rare forms include Inflammatory Breast Cancer and Paget's Disease of the breast.</p>

                </div>

                <h2>Risk Factors</h2>
                <h3>Non-modifiable factors:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Gender:</strong> Being female is the most significant risk factor.</li>
                    <li><strong>Age:</strong> Risk increases with age.</li>
                    <li><strong>Genetic mutations:</strong> Inherited mutations in genes like BRCA1 and BRCA2 elevate
                        risk.</li>
                    <li><strong>Family history:</strong> Having close relatives with breast cancer increases risk.</li>
                    <li><strong>Personal history:</strong> Previous breast cancer diagnosis heightens the risk of
                        recurrence.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Modifiable factors:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Reproductive history:</strong> Early menstruation (before age 12) or late menopause
                        (after 55) increases exposure to hormones, raising risk.</li>
                    <li><strong>Hormone replacement therapy (HRT):</strong> Long-term use of combined
                        estrogen-progestogen therapy during menopause is linked to higher risk.</li>
                    <li><strong>Alcohol consumption:</strong> Higher alcohol intake correlates with increased risk.</li>
                    <li><strong>Obesity and physical inactivity:</strong> Excess weight and lack of exercise are
                        associated with higher risk.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Pathophysiology</h2>
                <p>Breast cancer arises from genetic mutations leading to uncontrolled cell growth. Estrogen exposure
                    plays a significant role in promoting this growth. Mutations in tumor suppressor genes like BRCA1
                    and BRCA2 impair DNA repair mechanisms, facilitating cancer development. Overexpression of
                    oncogenes, such as HER2, also contributes to tumor progression.</p>

                <h2>Symptoms</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>A lump or thickening in the breast or underarm.</li>
                    <li>Change in breast size, shape, or appearance.</li>
                    <li>Dimpling or puckering of the skin.</li>
                    <li>Nipple inversion or discharge.</li>
                    <li>Redness or scaling of the nipple or breast skin.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Some individuals may not exhibit noticeable symptoms, underscoring the importance of regular
                    screenings.</p>

                <h2>Diagnosis</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Imaging tests:</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Mammography:</strong> X-ray imaging to detect abnormalities.</li>
                            <li><strong>Ultrasound:</strong> Determines if a lump is solid or fluid-filled.</li>
                            <li><strong>MRI:</strong> Provides detailed images, especially useful in high-risk
                                individuals.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Biopsy:</strong> Removal of tissue samples for microscopic examination to confirm cancer
                        presence and type.</li>
                    <li><strong>Laboratory tests:</strong> Hormone receptor tests (estrogen and progesterone) and HER2
                        status assessments guide treatment decisions.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Staging</h2>
                <p>Staging determines the extent of cancer spread and guides treatment planning. The TNM system
                    assesses:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Tumor size (T):</strong> Size and extent of the primary tumor.</li>
                    <li><strong>Node involvement (N):</strong> Degree of spread to nearby lymph nodes.</li>
                    <li><strong>Metastasis (M):</strong> Presence of distant spread to other body parts.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Stages range from 0 (non-invasive) to IV (metastatic), with higher stages indicating more advanced
                    disease.</p>

                <h2>Treatment</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Surgery:</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Lumpectomy:</strong> Removal of the tumor and a margin of surrounding tissue.
                            </li>
                            <li><strong>Mastectomy:</strong> Removal of the entire breast.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li id="liver"><strong>Radiation therapy:</strong> Uses high-energy rays to destroy cancer cells,
                        often
                        post-surgery.</li>
                    <li><strong>Chemotherapy:</strong> Systemic treatment with drugs to kill or inhibit cancer cells,
                        used before (neoadjuvant) or after (adjuvant) surgery.</li>
                    <li><strong>Hormonal therapy:</strong> For hormone receptor-positive cancers, medications like
                        tamoxifen or aromatase inhibitors block hormones that fuel cancer growth.</li>
                    <li><strong>Targeted therapy:</strong> Drugs like trastuzumab (Herceptin) target HER2-positive
                        breast cancer.</li>
                </ul>

                <h1>Heart Disease</h1>

                <p>Heart disease, also known as cardiovascular disease, refers to a range of conditions affecting the
                    heart and blood vessels. It is a leading cause of death globally, but many forms can be prevented or
                    managed with lifestyle changes and medical interventions.</p>

                <h2>Anatomy and Physiology of the Heart</h2>
                <p>The heart is a muscular organ located in the chest, responsible for pumping blood throughout the
                    body. It consists of four chambers: two upper atria and two lower ventricles. The heart's primary
                    functions include:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Pumping Oxygenated Blood:</strong> Delivering oxygen-rich blood to tissues and organs.
